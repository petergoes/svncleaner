svncleaner
==========

Little bash script to remove .svn directories from project folders

Usage
=====
1) Drop your project folder in the 'dropfolder' directory. The tree structure now becomes:
<pre>
|--dropfolder/
|	|__ your-project-folder/
|	|__ drop-your-folder-here.txt
|--README.MD
|--svncleaner.command
</pre>

2) Double click (or run) the svncleaner.command file

3) You now have a project folder without .svn directories
